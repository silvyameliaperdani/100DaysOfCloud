# AWS STS & Amazon Cognito - Course AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner on Udemy by Stephane Maarek

## Cloud Research
## AWS STS (Security Token Service)
- Enables you to create temporary, limited- privileges credentials to access your AWS resources
- Short-term credentials: you configure expiration period
- Use cases
	- Identity federation: manage user identities in external systems, and provide them with STS tokens to access AWS resources
	- IAM Roles for cross/same account access
	- IAM Roles for Amazon EC2: provide temporary credentials for EC2 instances to access AWS resources

## Amazon Cognito (simplified)
- Identity for your Web and Mobile applications users (potentially millions)
- Instead of creating them an IAM user, you create a user in Cognito
